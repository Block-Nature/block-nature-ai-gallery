BLOCK-NATURE: TECHNICAL VALIDATION PROTOCOL v1.0
------------------------------------------------

PHASE-01: BLACK VOID
- Target Score: 98.4%
- Logic: Detection of neural-organic synchronization.
- Argument: Analysis shows that the black void functions as a high-density data container. Strokes match human biological movement patterns at 98.4% accuracy.

PHASE-02: RED ENERGY
- Target Score: 97.2%
- Logic: 650nm Chromatic Intensity Analysis.
- Argument: High kinetic energy detected. The red spectrum simulates biological pulse and thermal data release within the digital protocol.

PHASE-03: BLUE ENTROPY
- Target Score: 92.1% (Standard) / 45.5% (Dissent)
- Logic: Shannon Entropy Variance.
- Argument: Chaos levels are calibrated to reflect marine salinization cycles. Dissenting agents may flag this as a "Protocol Safety Violation" due to high chaos.

PHASE-04: WHITE ETHER
- Target Score: 99.1%
- Logic: Peak Luminance & Liminality Scan.
- Argument: The intentional overexposure (White Ether) represents the erasure of physical glaciers. The boundary between digital synthesis and physical reality is neutralized.

PHASE-05: GREEN GROWTH
- Target Score: 100%
- Logic: Symbiotic Recursion Loop.
- Argument: Point of absolute convergence. The algorithm transitions from "mimicking nature" to "becoming nature." Regeneration logic is fully validated.
